# The Investment Portfolio

## How will you spend your money? 

This application is made for anyone who wants an organized portfolio that displays all the investments they made. 
To accommodate for multiple purchases of the same stock, each stock is further organized into list of purchases for that 
stock. For example, if an individual buys Tesla stock on 3 different occasions, all 3 purchases would be organized 
under Tesla. This organization allows users the ability to view purchases they made for a specific stock. 

It's important to note that the user input the stock **ticker** when they buy/sell an investment. This is to ensure 
that each stock is registered only once in the portfolio and thus allows for optimal organization. 

When buying a stock, the user will input the following:
- *Stock ticker*
- *Total Amount of Money Invested*
- *Today's Price/Share*
When it comes time to sell, the portfolio holder chooses which purchase they would like to sell for that given stock. 
For example, going back to the 3 separate purchases of Tesla, if the user wants to sell their 2nd investment for Tesla
then the user has this ability. In addition, the user can decide on the percentage of shares they wish to sell. The 
updated investment will exist in the portfolio. If the user decides to sell all their shares for that investment,
the investment will not be removed from the portfolio as I believe this to be important data much like a receipt. 


## Reason For This Project... 

I created this Investment Portfolio application because I wanted a platform that could be used by any person... 
What I mean by this is that this application is meant for anyone who wants to or is already investing. For anyone who 
finds it difficult to stay organized (like myself), this application helps with that.
