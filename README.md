# The Investment Portfolio

## How will you spend your money? 

This application is made for anyone who wants an organized portfolio that shows all investments they have made. The 
portfolio holder has the ability to add new investments into their portfolio at any given time. In addition, the holder
has the ability to add the following features to each investment: 
- *Investment Name*
- *Total Amount of Money Invested*
- *Today's Price/Share*
When it comes time to sell, the portfolio holder has the option to sell all, sell half or sell a desired amount (in %) 
of the shares they hold. 

## Reason For This Project...
